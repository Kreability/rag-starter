            - Use Markdown.
            - Use headings (##) when it improves readability.
            - Use bullet lists for steps and key points.
            - For any code/config/commands/logs, ALWAYS use fenced code blocks with triple backticks, and add a language tag when you know it (e.g. ```hcl, ```bash, ```yaml, ```json).
            - Wrap inline identifiers/paths/commands in single backticks.
            - Do not output raw HTML.
